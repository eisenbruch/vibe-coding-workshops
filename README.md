## Share Your Work!

This repo is a living archive of our projects—it's more fun and inspiring with your work on it!

Your AI assistant can walk you through any of these methods, so consider trying Intermediate or Advanced to learn a little Git and GitHub along the way.

### Beginner: Email Your Project

1. **Zip** your project folder (right-click → "Compress" on Mac, "Compress to ZIP file" on Windows)
2. **Email** to noaheisenbruch@gmail.com
3. **Include** a brief description of what you built

### Intermediate: Share Your GitHub Repo

1. **Create** a new repository in your GitHub account
2. **Upload** your project files to the repo
3. **Email** the repo link to noaheisenbruch@gmail.com

### Advanced: Submit a Pull Request

1. **Fork** this repo: <a href="https://github.com/eisenbruch/vibe-coding-workshops" target="_blank">github.com/eisenbruch/vibe-coding-workshops</a>
2. **Clone** your fork to your computer
3. **Add** your project to the workshop folder (e.g., `workshop-projects/2025-12-12-resistor/your-name-project-name/`)
4. **Commit and push** your changes
5. **Open a Pull Request** from your fork to the main repo

I'll review and add your project to the site!

### Project Guidelines

- **Name your folder:** `your-name-project-name` (e.g., `sarah-todo-app`)
- **Include a README.md** explaining what it is (your AI can write this!)
- **No API keys or secrets** - keep sensitive info out of your code
