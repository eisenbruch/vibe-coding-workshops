# DomainFlip - Project Summary

## Executive Summary

DomainFlip transforms domain name trading into a fast-paced, social, and viral experience. By combining the rapid liquidity of prediction markets (Kalshi/Polymarket), the tradability and hype of NFTs, and traditional domain investing, we're creating the first truly modern domain trading platform.

**The Core Innovation:** Instant domain trading with AI-powered valuations, social discovery features, and peer-to-peer domain swapping - making domain speculation as exciting and accessible as trading digital collectibles.

**Target Market:** Domain investors, entrepreneurs, speculators, and digital asset enthusiasts looking for fast-moving opportunities in the domain space.

**Revenue Model:** Transaction fees, premium subscriptions, and domain registration markups.

## The Problem

The domain trading industry is stuck in the past. Existing platforms like Sedo are slow, opaque, and lack the social and viral elements that make modern digital marketplaces engaging. Domain trading should be:

- **Fast** - Instant listings, instant purchases, instant trades
- **Social** - Discover trending domains through community activity
- **Transparent** - Clear valuations and real-time market data
- **Exciting** - Gamified experiences that make trading fun and competitive

Currently, none of this exists in domain trading.
