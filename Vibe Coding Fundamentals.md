> **💡 Tip:** Start here to test ideas and learn prompting. When you're ready for real projects, move to intermediate or advanced tools.

---

### Intermediate: Desktop Applications
*All-in-one AI assistants with GUI interfaces and agentic capabilities* \
*Best for beginners, non-developers, and quick projects without terminal or IDE experience*

**Desktop Applications:**
- **<a href="https://claude.ai/download" target="_blank">Claude Desktop</a>** - Three modes: Chat (conversation), Cowork (agentic file automation), and Code (full coding agent on cloud VMs)
- **<a href="https://openai.com/chatgpt/desktop" target="_blank">ChatGPT Desktop</a>** - Singular Chat mode, not as powerful as Claude Desktop. The following Pros/Limitations do not apply to ChatGPT Desktop.

**✅ Pros:**
- Full coding capabilities without terminal experience
- Claude Cowork automates non-coding tasks (organize files, create spreadsheets from screenshots, draft reports)
- Claude Code can edit code that is local (on your computer) or in the cloud (GitHub)
- Extensions (MCP servers) and Connectors to add data from your accounts, use other apps, get access to additional knowledge, and extend it's capabilities in other ways
- All-in-one interface: "Chat for thinking, Cowork for doing, Code for building"

**❌ Limitations:**
- Less suited for developing and testing large projects

> **💡 Tip:** Claude Desktop is ideal for research, quick prototypes, and non-coding file tasks. When you need full development environment for testing and deploying your projects, move to IDE/CLI tools.

---

### Advanced: IDEs with AI Extensions & CLI (Command Line Interface) Tools
*Professional development environments running on your local machine* \
*Best for developing full projects, testing, and deploying*

**AI Coding Tools:**

*All tools support full codebase understanding, git integration, MCP servers, and more* \
*They are available as both VS Code extensions (chat interface) and standalone CLI tools (terminal interface)*

- **<a href="https://claude.ai/code" target="_blank">Claude Code</a>** - Recommended for best overall quality and speed, especially for large projects
- **<a href="https://chatgpt.com/codex" target="_blank">ChatGPT Codex</a>** - Better at problem-solving with tricky bugs, but slower overall
- **<a href="https://codeassist.google" target="_blank">Gemini Code Assist</a>** - Recently updated with major improvements, great free option to get started

**AI-Native IDEs:**
- **<a href="https://cursor.com" target="_blank">Cursor</a>**
- **<a href="https://antigravity.google" target="_blank">Google Antigravity</a>** 

**✅ Pros:**
- Explore and edit your code while your agents work
- Best for large refactoring and complex features
- Best for testing and deploying
- Deep git integration
- Custom commands and workflows
- MCP server support for extended capabilities
- Professional development environment

**❌ Limitations:**

---

### Tool Selection Framework

Ask yourself these questions:

1. **What are you building?** Simple tool/visual vs. complex app
2. **What's your experience level?** Never coded vs. comfortable with code
3. **What's your timeline?** Quick prototype vs. production-ready
4. **What's your budget?** Free tier vs. paid subscription
5. **Do you need automation?** Simple tasks vs. complex multi-step workflows

## Core Approaches

### The Vibe Coding Spectrum

All projects exist somewhere on this spectrum between two approaches:

```

```

#### Approach 1: Minimal Info → Iterative Refinement

**Example:** <a href="https://nerktendo.com/" target="_blank">Nerktendo</a>

**How it works:** Start broad, refine through back-and-forth conversation

**✅ Pros:**
- Great for exploring possibilities and experimenting
- Sparks creative directions you wouldn't think of
- Lower barrier to starting

**❌ Cons:**
- Takes more back-and-forth
- May drift from original vision
- Can be difficult to guide refinement with minimal info

#### Approach 2: Comprehensive Brief → Execute

**Example:** <a href="https://nerktendo.com/domainflip" target="_blank">DomainFlip</a>

**How it works:** Define everything upfront - features, style, structure, functions, rules, edge cases

**✅ Pros:**
- Faster to a feature-full, polished result
- Stays true to vision
- Better for complex requirements

**❌ Cons:**
- Requires knowing what you want
- Less room for discovery
- Harder for beginners to write good briefs (but use AI to help)

**How to do it:** Use an LLM (not a coding AI) to create comprehensive planning documents before you start coding.

**DomainFlip workflow:**
1. **Planning phase**: I asked the an AI chatbot to create a comprehensive plan for building a website that is designed to be passed to an AI coding agent so it would know exactly what to build without any room for interpretation. I described my idea with all the details I had thought of so far and asked the chatbot to help build out the idea into a full company and product plan.
2. **Document creation**: The AI asked clarifying questions to complete the product idea, then developed 8 detailed documents covering:
   - Project overview and goals
   - Technical architecture
   - Design specifications
   - Feature requirements and edge cases
3. **Execution phase**: I fed all documents to Claude Code in a single prompt
4. **Result**: One hour later, the complete site was built exactly to spec

**The key:** comprehensive upfront documentation eliminates ambiguity and reduces iteration.

> **💡 Pro Tip:** Use an AI chatbot (not coding assistant) to plan your project in detail, then feed that plan to an AI coding agent. DomainFlip was created with only 1 Claude Code prompt, but it was fed 8 different multi page documents outlining the entire project in extreme detail.

> **🎁 Bonus:** Read through the <a href="https://github.com/eisenbruch/vibe-coding-workshops/tree/master/docs/domainflip" target="_blank">DomainFlip summary and build documents</a>

### Good Prompts vs Bad Prompts

| ❌ Bad Prompt | ✅ Good Prompt |
|--------------|----------------|
| "Make me a website" | "Create a single-page portfolio site with a hero section, 3 project cards, and a contact form. Use a dark theme with blue accents." |
| "Fix it" | "The submit button doesn't work. When I click it, nothing happens. No errors in console. Here's the relevant code: [paste code]" |
| "Add a database" | "Add a SQLite database to store user tasks. Include fields for: id, title, description, due_date, completed (boolean). Create functions for CRUD operations." |
| "Make it look better" | "Improve the card component: add subtle shadows, rounded corners (8px), and a hover effect that slightly lifts the card." |
| "It's broken" | "Expected: clicking 'Save' should show a success message. Actual: page refreshes and data is lost. Browser: Chrome. Error in console: [paste error]" |

**Key principles:**
- Be specific about what you want
- Include relevant context (tech stack, constraints, goals)
- When reporting bugs: expected vs actual behavior + any errors
- Describe the outcome, not just the task

## Working with AI Coding Agents

This section focuses on Claude Code but the concepts and techniques apply to all agents.

### Vibe Coding Essential Techniques

#### Interrupt When Needed
Sometimes AI goes off the rails. If you see it going down the wrong path, interrupt it, go back (double tap `esc`), and give better instructions. This saves memory and credits vs. correcting mistakes later. AI is bad at remembering what it did wrong.

#### Self-Checking
Ask your AI to check its own (or your) work for bugs and see if there's room for improvement. Optimizing for resources and speed is generally good (unless it isn't).

#### Working Through Stubborn Bugs

When you have a bug AI can't solve after multiple attempts:

1. Try a different coding agent (e.g. ChatGPT Codex)
2. Ask 2 different AIs the same question
    1. Give each AI the other's response for analysis
    2. Have both provide updated plans
    3. Give both responses to a new agent for comprehensive summary
    4. Have another new agent read and implement the solution

#### Debugging Workflow

AI agents fix issues best when given all relevant information:

1. Use browser DevTools Console to find errors and warnings: AI agents love reading errors and warnings
2. Describe what you want and what the current issue is in full detail
3. Provide full context especially if debugging in a fresh conversation

#### Beyond Coding

Claude and other AI agents can help with more than just code if they have access to the right tools:

- File and document organization
- Obsidian note organization and project management
- Data visualization
- Research and repetitive tasks

### Claude Code CLI Commands

| Command    | Purpose                                                                  |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `claude`   | Start Claude in your terminal.                                           |
| `shift + tab` | Change modes: planning, accept edits, ask for permission (defualt) |
| ` @ ` | Mention a file within your folder structure (excludes `git ignore` files)
| `esc`      | Interrupt Claude while it's working.                                     |
| `esc esc`  | Go back in conversation and code history.                                |
| `/init`    | Review codebase and create CLAUDE.md documentation file for AI reference |
| `#memory`  | Easily add to CLAUDE.md memory                                           |
| `/compact` | Compact conversation to clear space while keeping some memory            |
| `/clear`   | Better space clearing but loses memory (or quit/restart Claude Code)     |
| `/usage`   | Check current usage level                                                |
| `/resume`  | Resume a previous conversation                                           |
| `/review`  | Code review                                                              |


> **💡 Tip:** Store important instructions in CLAUDE.md to prevent AI from doing unwanted things (overwriting data, unnecessary builds, etc.). CLAUDE.md files exist for your user and each individual project folder where you use Claude Code. Use this to your advantage - global knowledge vs project specific knowledge.

---

### Claude Code Advanced Features

#### Claude Agents (Tasks)
Multiple Claude Code instances that autonomously complete complex workflows in parallel.

**When to use it:** You have a large or multi-part task — analyzing several data sources, refactoring across files, or running independent subtasks simultaneously.

**How to use it:** Ask Claude to start agents or tasks. It will spawn parallel instances that coordinate and report back.

**Example:**
```
"Spin up agents to analyze each of these three CSV reports and summarize the findings"
```

---

#### Custom Commands
Reusable shortcuts that save your most common prompts so you don't have to describe them each time.

**When to use it:** You find yourself repeating the same type of request — scraping a new source, committing with a specific format, generating boilerplate.

**How to use it:** Create markdown instruction files in `.claude/commands/` (project) or `~/.claude/commands/` (global), then invoke with `/command-name`.

**Example:**
```
# .claude/commands/new-source.md
Scrape the provided URL, extract the main content, clean the data,
and save it as a structured JSON file in the /data directory.
```
Then use: `/new-source https://example.com/data`

---

#### Git Worktrees
Work on multiple branches simultaneously without switching contexts or cloning the repo again.

**When to use it:** You're building a feature but need to fix a bug on main, want to test different approaches side-by-side, or do code review without disrupting your current work.

**How to use it:**
```bash
# Create a worktree for a branch
git worktree add ../project-feature-branch feature-branch-name

# Each worktree has its own directory and branch, but shares git history
# Claude Code can work across worktrees simultaneously

# Clean up when done
git worktree remove ../project-feature-branch
```

> **💡 Tip:** Name worktree directories clearly (e.g., `project-name-feature-name`) to avoid confusion when multiple Claude Code instances are running.

> **💡 Tip:** If worktrees are confusing to you (or if any advanced workflow is), ask Claude to do it for you and teach you along the way.

---

#### MCP Servers
Plugins that connect Claude to external tools, APIs, databases, and services through a standardized protocol.

**When to use it:** You need real-time data, want to connect to services like GitHub/Slack/Google Drive, or need specialized capabilities like browser automation or web search.

**How to use it:**

*Claude Desktop:* Settings → Extensions → Browse extensions (one-click install)

*Claude Code:*
```bash
# Add a server (use --scope user for all projects)
claude mcp add github --scope user

# Add with environment variables
claude mcp add -e API_KEY=your_key servername -- npx @org/server

# Check what's installed
claude mcp list
```

**Common servers:**

| Server | What it does |
|--------|-------------|
| Filesystem | Read/write local files with permission-based access |
| GitHub | Manage PRs, issues, and repository operations |
| Puppeteer | Browser automation and web scraping |
| Context7 | Up-to-date library docs with version-specific references |
| Brave Search | Real-time web search results |
| Sequential Thinking | Break down complex tasks into structured steps |
| Google Drive | Access and manage Drive documents |
| Slack | Send messages and interact with Slack workspaces |

**Configuration scopes:**

| Scope | Flag | Availability |
|-------|------|-------------|
| Local | *(default)* | Current directory only |
| User | `--scope user` | All projects globally |
| Project | `.mcp.json` file | Shared with team via version control |

> **💡 Tip:** Use user scope for personal tools, project scope for team-shared servers. Restart Claude Desktop or Claude Code after adding servers to activate them.
