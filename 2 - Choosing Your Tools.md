# Choosing Your Tools
*Part of the [Vibe Coding Workshop](https://eisenbruch.github.io/vibe-coding-workshops/) series* \
*By Noah Eisenbruch - noaheisenbruch@gmail.com*

Choosing the right tool depends on your experience, what you're building, and how much setup you want. This guide covers the main categories — see the [AI Tools Directory](AI%20Tools%20Directory.md) for a full catalog.

## Beginner: Browser-Based Tools
*Best for first-time coders, quick prototypes, and learning the basics* \
*No installation required - just open a browser and start*

**Chat Interfaces:**
- **<a href="https://claude.ai" target="_blank">Claude.ai</a>** - Advanced reasoning and coding
- **<a href="https://chatgpt.com" target="_blank">ChatGPT</a>** - General purpose AI assistant
- **<a href="https://gemini.google.com" target="_blank">Gemini</a>** - Google's multimodal AI

**✅ Pros:**
- No setup required
- Instant access from any device
- Great for learning and experimentation

**❌ Limitations:**
- Limited to simple projects
- Limited version control integration

> **Tip:** Start here to test ideas and learn prompting. When you're ready for real projects, move to intermediate or advanced tools.

## Intermediate: Desktop Applications
*All-in-one AI assistants with GUI interfaces and agentic capabilities* \
*Best for beginners, non-developers, and quick projects without terminal or IDE experience*

**Desktop Applications:**
- **<a href="https://claude.ai/download" target="_blank">Claude Desktop</a>** - Three modes: Chat (conversation), Cowork (agentic file automation), and Code (full coding agent on cloud VMs)
- **<a href="https://openai.com/chatgpt/desktop" target="_blank">ChatGPT Desktop</a>** - Singular Chat mode, not as powerful as Claude Desktop. The following Pros/Limitations do not apply to ChatGPT Desktop.

**✅ Pros:**
- Full coding capabilities without terminal experience
- Claude Cowork automates non-coding tasks (organize files, create spreadsheets from screenshots, draft reports)
- Claude Code can edit code that is local (on your computer) or in the cloud (GitHub)
- Extensions (MCP servers) and Connectors to add data from your accounts, use other apps, get access to additional knowledge, and extend it's capabilities in other ways
- All-in-one interface: "Chat for thinking, Cowork for doing, Code for building"

**❌ Limitations:**
- Less suited for developing and testing large projects

> **Tip:** Claude Desktop is ideal for research, quick prototypes, and non-coding file tasks. When you need full development environment for testing and deploying your projects, move to IDE/CLI tools.

---

## Advanced: IDEs with AI Extensions & CLI (Command Line Interface) Tools
*Professional development environments running on your local machine* \
*Best for developing full projects, testing, and deploying*

**AI Coding Tools:**

*All tools support full codebase understanding, git integration, MCP servers, and more* \
*They are available as both VS Code extensions (chat interface) and standalone CLI tools (terminal interface)*

- **<a href="https://claude.ai/code" target="_blank">Claude Code</a>** - Recommended for best overall quality and speed, especially for large projects
- **<a href="https://chatgpt.com/codex" target="_blank">ChatGPT Codex</a>** - Better at problem-solving with tricky bugs, but slower overall
- **<a href="https://codeassist.google" target="_blank">Gemini Code Assist</a>** - Recently updated with major improvements, great free option to get started

**AI-Native IDEs:**
- **<a href="https://cursor.com" target="_blank">Cursor</a>**
- **<a href="https://antigravity.google" target="_blank">Google Antigravity</a>**

**✅ Pros:**
- Explore and edit your code while your agents work
- Best for large refactoring and complex features
- Best for testing and deploying
- Deep git integration
- Custom commands and workflows
- MCP server support for extended capabilities
- Professional development environment

**❌ Limitations:**
- More setup and configuration
- Steeper learning curve
- Requires terminal comfort (for CLI tools)

> **When to use IDE/CLI vs Desktop:** Choose IDE/CLI if you've moved beyond the simple prototype phase and need to start adding complex features, testing, and deploying.

> **Tip:** Use Git version control! These tools make it easy to track changes, experiment safely, and collaborate professionally.

> **Learn More:** See [Advanced Techniques](Advanced%20Techniques.md) for commands and advanced techniques.

> **Learn More:** See the [AI Tools Directory](AI%20Tools%20Directory.md) for more specialized vibe coding platforms, web-hosted autonomous agents, and more.

## Tool Selection Framework

Ask yourself these questions:

1. **What are you building?** Simple tool/visual vs. complex app
2. **What's your experience level?** Never coded vs. comfortable with code
3. **What's your timeline?** Quick prototype vs. production-ready
4. **What's your budget?** Free tier vs. paid subscription
5. **Do you need automation?** Simple tasks vs. complex multi-step workflows
