# Workshop Introduction
*Part of the [Vibe Coding Workshop](https://eisenbruch.github.io/vibe-coding-workshops/) series* \
*By Noah Eisenbruch - noaheisenbruch@gmail.com*
## Welcome

This is a hands-on workshop for building real software with AI — no prior coding experience required. "Vibe coding" is the practice of using AI tools to write, debug, and ship code by describing what you want in plain language. Instead of memorizing syntax, you'll learn how to communicate effectively with AI to turn your ideas into working projects.

**What you'll learn:**
- How to choose and use AI coding tools (from browser-based chat to full development environments)
- Core techniques for prompting, iterating, and debugging with AI
- How to set up a project, manage versions with Git, and deploy to the web
- Practical strategies for building anything from simple tools to complex web applications

**Using this site:**
This site is your reference throughout and after the workshop. Use the navigation menu to move through the workshop path in order, starting with Vibe Coding Fundamentals. Each document builds on the last, but they also work as standalone references you can return to anytime. The Reference section covers advanced topics and a directory of AI tools for further exploration.

## Example Projects

**1. Glitch QR** (<a href="https://github.com/eisenbruch" target="_blank">github.com/eisenbruch/glitch-qr</a>)
- **Type:** QR code generation with a twist
- **Key Learning:** You can vibe code a simple tool in minutes, and it's fun

**2. Snark AI** (<a href="https://snark-ai.com" target="_blank">snark-ai.com</a>)
- **Type:** Satirical AI email service
- **Key Learning:** Vibe coding actually works to make services and websites

**3. Nerktendo** (<a href="https://nerktendo.com" target="_blank">nerktendo.com</a>)
- **Type:** Retro interface and portfolio
- **Key Learning:** Sometimes AI is really bad at things. Try different tools and dive deeper into vibe coding.

**4. LinkPee** (<a href="https://linkp.ee" target="_blank">linkp.ee</a>)
- **Type:** Fully functional "link in bio" service with secure authentication & user profiles
- **Key Learning:** "Complex" features are absolutely achievable

**5. Weather Worsener** (<a href="https://nerktendo.com/weather-worsener" target="_blank">nerktendo.com/weather-worsener</a>)
- **Type:** Interactive game
- **Key Learning:** Fun and loose iterative projects are great for experimenting with concepts and mechanics and allow you to explore concepts and themes freely.

**6. DomainFlip** (<a href="https://nerktendo.com/domainflip" target="_blank">nerktendo.com/domainflip</a>)
- **Type:** Investor-ready startup demo
- **Key Learning:** Clear vision + detailed context = polished results

**7. TrafficVision.Live** (<a href="https://trafficvision.live/?utm_source=vibe-coding-cheatsheet&utm_medium=resource&utm_campaign=example-project" target="_blank">trafficvision.live</a>)
- **Type:** Interactive map and database service with user focused features
- **Key Learning:** AI takes time to discover things like humans (optimization) and needs to take similar approaches a human would. They may need to be guided towards a solution.

**Other Projects**
- Raspberry Pi powered instant camera - prints instant picture stickers with text, current date/time
- Blender Addon that optimally rotates a 3D object to minimize its bounding box - usefull for manufacturing processes

> **Key Takeaway:** Don't limit yourself. If you think it should exist (no matter how silly), just try to create it. Vibe coding can make testing concepts easier than creating a mockup.

> **Remember:** AI can help with more than just  code - it can help prototype your hardware, organize your files, and much more.
