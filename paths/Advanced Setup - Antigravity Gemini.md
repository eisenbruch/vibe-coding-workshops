<!-- wizard-step: 1 | title: Download Antigravity -->

## Step 1: Download Antigravity

1. Go to <a href="https://antigravity.google/" target="_blank">antigravity.google</a>
2. Download for your operating system (Mac or Windows)
3. Run the installer
4. Launch Antigravity and sign in with your Google account

<!-- wizard-step: 2 | title: Open the Agent Manager -->

## Step 2: Open the Agent Manager

Once Antigravity is open, click **Open Agent Manager**. This brings up the built-in Gemini interface.

### Optionally: Use the Gemini CLI

If you prefer the terminal experience, you can open Antigravity's terminal and type `gemini` after installing it via <a href="https://codeassist.google" target="_blank">codeassist.google</a>.

<!-- wizard-step: 3 | title: Create Your Project Folder -->

## Step 3: Create Your Project Folder

1. Create a folder called `workshop-project` on your Desktop
2. In Antigravity: **Open Workspace** → select your folder

<!-- wizard-step: 4 | title: Install Developer Tools -->

## Step 4: Install Developer Tools

Paste this prompt into the Gemini Agent Manager:

```
Check my system and install any of these developer tools that are missing:
- Homebrew (Mac only — package manager)
- Node.js and npm (JavaScript runtime)
- Git (version control)
- gh (GitHub CLI)
- firebase-tools (Firebase deployment — install globally with npm)

For each tool: check if it's already installed first, skip it if so.
For anything you can't install directly, give me the exact steps to do it myself.
Don't sign in to or configure anything yet — just install.
```

<!-- wizard-step: 5 | title: You're Ready! -->

## Step 5: You're Ready!

Your setup is complete:

- ✅ Antigravity installed
- ✅ Gemini Agent open
- ✅ Project folder ready
- ✅ Developer tools installed

Head to the [Group Project](../Group%20Project.md) to start building with the group!
