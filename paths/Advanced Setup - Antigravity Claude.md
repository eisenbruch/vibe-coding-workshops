<!-- wizard-step: 5 | title: Install Developer Tools -->

## Step 5: Install Developer Tools

Paste this prompt into Claude Code:

```
Check my system and install any of these developer tools that are missing:
- Homebrew (Mac only — package manager)
- Node.js and npm (JavaScript runtime)
- Git (version control)
- gh (GitHub CLI)
- firebase-tools (Firebase deployment — install globally with npm)

For each tool: check if it's already installed first, skip it if so.
For anything you can't install directly, give me the exact steps to do it myself.
Don't sign in to or configure anything yet — just install.
```

> **Note:** Claude will ask permission to run commands — say yes. This may take a few minutes.
