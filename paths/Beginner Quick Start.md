No downloads, no setup — just a browser. These AI tools build and preview your creation right in the chat window.

## Step 1: Pick a Tool

Open any of these in your browser:

| Tool | How It Works |
|------|-------------|
| <a href="https://claude.ai" target="_blank">Claude.ai</a> | Generates an interactive **artifact** — see and use the result right in the chat |
| <a href="https://chatgpt.com" target="_blank">ChatGPT</a> | Generates a **canvas** — live preview right in the conversation |
| <a href="https://gemini.google.com" target="_blank">Gemini</a> | Generates code with a **preview** panel alongside the chat |
| <a href="https://aistudio.google.com" target="_blank">Google AI Studio</a> | Prototype with Gemini models — code output with preview |

## Step 2: Try It Now

1. Type a prompt like this into your chosen tool:

```
Create a personal countdown timer to New Year's Eve. Make it visually appealing with a dark theme and animated numbers.
```

2. The AI builds it and **shows you the result right there** — no copying, no saving, no files
3. Want changes? Just say: "Make it neon green" or "Add confetti when it hits zero"

That's vibe coding: describe → see it appear → iterate by talking.

## Step 3: What You Can Build

Browser AI is great for quick single-page creations:

- Calculators, timers, and converters
- Quizzes and simple games
- Visual demos and animations
- Landing pages and portfolios

> **Note:** These creations live in the chat session — they're not saved as files on your computer. For real projects with version control and deployment, check out the Intermediate or Advanced setup paths.
