# Beginner Quick Start

*Part of the [Vibe Coding Workshop](https://workshop.nerktek.com/) series*

This is a quick demo of the simplest way to vibe code — no downloads, no setup, just a browser. The AI tools below render your creation right in the browser, so you see results immediately.

## Browser AI Tools

These tools let you describe what you want and see it built in real time, right in the browser window:

| Tool | What Happens |
|------|-------------|
| <a href="https://claude.ai" target="_blank">Claude.ai</a> | Generates an interactive **artifact** that renders inline — you see and interact with the result directly in the chat |
| <a href="https://chatgpt.com" target="_blank">ChatGPT</a> | Generates a **canvas** that renders inline — live preview right in the conversation |
| <a href="https://gemini.google.com" target="_blank">Gemini</a> | Generates code with a **preview** panel — see the result alongside the chat |
| <a href="https://aistudio.google.com" target="_blank">Google AI Studio</a> | Prototype with Gemini models — code output with preview |

## Demo: Try It Now

1. Open any of the tools above
2. Type a prompt like:

   > Create a personal countdown timer to New Year's Eve. Make it visually appealing with a dark theme and animated numbers.

3. The AI builds it and **shows you the result right there** — no copying, no saving, no files. You can click, scroll, and interact with it immediately.

4. Want to change something? Just tell the AI: "Make it neon green" or "Add confetti when it hits zero." It updates in place.

That's vibe coding at its most basic: describe what you want, see it appear, iterate by talking.

## What This Is Good For

Browser AI is great for quick experiments and single-page creations: calculators, timers, quizzes, visual demos, simple games. You describe, it builds, you see it instantly.

## Limitations

- **One-off creations** — the result lives in the chat session, not as a saved project
- **No file management** — the AI can't create or edit files on your computer
- **No version control** — no way to undo changes or track history
- **Single-page only** — multi-page apps or complex projects need real tools

For anything beyond a quick experiment, the Intermediate and Advanced tracks give you tools that manage files, track changes, and build real projects. See the [Welcome page](../Welcome.md) to pick a track.
