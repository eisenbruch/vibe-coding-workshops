## What is Vibe Coding?

Vibe coding is the practice of using AI to write code by describing what you want in plain language. Instead of learning programming syntax, you communicate your ideas to large language models (LLMs) that generate working code for you. You guide the process — the AI handles the implementation.

This isn't about replacing developers. It's about making software creation accessible to everyone. Whether you're building a quick tool, a personal website, or a full web application, vibe coding lets you focus on *what* you want to build rather than *how* to write it.

No prior coding experience is required. You'll learn the techniques, tools, and workflow to go from idea to deployed project in a single workshop.

**What you'll learn:**
- How to choose and use AI coding tools (from browser-based chat to full development environments)
- Core techniques for prompting, iterating, and debugging with AI
- How to set up a project, manage versions with Git, and deploy to the web
- Practical strategies for building anything from simple tools to complex web applications

## Example Projects

**1. Glitch QR** (<a href="https://github.com/eisenbruch/glitch-qr" target="_blank">github.com/eisenbruch/glitch-qr</a>)
- **Type:** QR code generation with a twist
- **Key Learning:** You can vibe code a simple tool in minutes, and it's fun

**2. Snark AI** (<a href="https://snark-ai.com" target="_blank">snark-ai.com</a>)
- **Type:** Satirical AI email service
- **Key Learning:** Vibe coding actually works to make services and websites

**3. Nerktendo** (<a href="https://nerktendo.com" target="_blank">nerktendo.com</a>)
- **Type:** Retro interface and portfolio
- **Key Learning:** Sometimes AI is really bad at things. Try different tools and dive deeper.

**4. LinkPee** (<a href="https://linkp.ee" target="_blank">linkp.ee</a>)
- **Type:** Fully functional "link in bio" service
- **Key Learning:** "Complex" features are absolutely achievable

**5. Weather Worsener** (<a href="https://nerktendo.com/weather-worsener" target="_blank">nerktendo.com/weather-worsener</a>)
- **Type:** Interactive game
- **Key Learning:** Fun iterative projects are great for experimenting

**6. DomainFlip** (<a href="https://nerktendo.com/domainflip" target="_blank">nerktendo.com/domainflip</a>)
- **Type:** Investor-ready startup demo
- **Key Learning:** Clear vision + detailed context = polished results

**7. TrafficVision.Live** (<a href="https://trafficvision.live" target="_blank">trafficvision.live</a>)
- **Type:** Interactive map and database service
- **Key Learning:** AI takes time to discover things like optimization and may need guidance

**Other Projects**
- Raspberry Pi powered instant camera - prints instant picture stickers with text, current date/time
- Blender Addon that optimally rotates a 3D object to minimize its bounding box - useful for manufacturing processes

> **Key Takeaway:** Don't limit yourself. If you think it should exist (no matter how silly), just try to create it. Vibe coding can make testing concepts easier than creating a mockup.

> **Remember:** AI can help with more than just code - it can help prototype your hardware, organize your files, and much more.

## Pick Your Path

### Workshop Participants: Pick Your Tool

Everyone will build the same group project together, but using different tools depending on your comfort level. Pick the path that fits you best — the end result is the same regardless of which tool you choose.

**Quick Demo / Just Curious?**
-> [Beginner Quick Start](paths/Beginner%20Quick%20Start.md) -- Try vibe coding in your browser with zero setup. Great as a reference or quick demo.

### Workshop Tracks

These are the guided paths with step-by-step setup instructions:

### Intermediate Track
- **Best for:** First-time coders, non-developers, anyone who prefers a visual interface
- **Paid:** [Claude Desktop](paths/Intermediate%20Setup%20-%20Claude%20Desktop.md) — All-in-one AI assistant with Chat + Cowork modes
- **Free:** [Google AI Studio](paths/Intermediate%20Setup%20-%20Google%20AI%20Studio.md) — Browser-based AI workspace with Gemini
- **What you'll use:** Desktop app (no IDE needed)
- **Setup time:** ~5 minutes

### Advanced Track
- **Best for:** Comfortable with computers, want professional tools, ready for the terminal
- **Paid:** [Claude Code](paths/Advanced%20Setup%20-%20Claude%20Code.md) — AI agent in VS Code / terminal
- **Free:** [Gemini CLI](paths/Advanced%20Setup%20-%20Gemini%20CLI.md) — Free AI agent in VS Code / terminal
- **What you'll use:** VS Code + terminal
- **Setup time:** ~15 minutes

> **Not sure?** Start with Intermediate — you can always level up later. The group project works the same regardless of which tool you pick.

## Tool Comparison

A quick overview of the major AI models and when to reach for each:

- **Claude:** The architect. Best for backend logic, complex architecture, and understanding large projects.
- **Gemini:** The speed demon. Excellent for writing, rapid prototyping, and converting screenshots to UI code. Significantly faster.
- **ChatGPT:** The specialist. Useful for tackling specific tricky bugs other models struggle with.

> **Tip:** Switch models when you get stuck!
