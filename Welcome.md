## What is Vibe Coding?

Vibe coding is the practice of using AI to write code by describing what you want in plain language. Instead of learning programming syntax, you communicate your ideas to large language models (LLMs) that generate working code for you. You guide the process — the AI handles the implementation.

Vibe coding makes software creation accessible to everyone. Whether you're building a quick tool, a personal website, or a full application, vibe coding lets you focus on *what* you want to build rather than *how* to create it technically.

No prior coding experience is required, but it greatly helps to have a general understanding of the tools and frameworks used to build your project and how they fit together, in order to create. Your AI can teach you everything you need to know. 

**What you'll learn:**
In this workshop you'll learn the techniques, tools, and workflow to go from idea to deployed project.

You'll learn:
- How to use any AI coding agent
- Core techniques for prompting, iterating, and debugging with AI
- How to set up a project, manage versions with Git, and deploy to the web
- Practical strategies for building anything from simple tools to complex applications

## Example Projects

**1. Glitch QR** (<a href="https://github.com/eisenbruch/glitch-qr" target="_blank">github.com/eisenbruch/glitch-qr</a>)
- **Type:** QR code generation with a twist
- **Key Learning:** You can vibe code a simple tool in minutes, and it's fun

**2. Snark AI** (<a href="https://snark-ai.com" target="_blank">snark-ai.com</a>)
- **Type:** Satirical AI email service
- **Key Learning:** Vibe coding actually works to make services and websites

**3. Nerktendo** (<a href="https://nerktendo.com" target="_blank">nerktendo.com</a>)
- **Type:** Retro interface and portfolio
- **Key Learning:** Sometimes AI is really bad at things. Try different tools and dive deeper.

**4. LinkPee** (<a href="https://linkp.ee" target="_blank">linkp.ee</a>)
- **Type:** Fully functional "link in bio" service
- **Key Learning:** "Complex" features are absolutely achievable

**5. Weather Worsener** (<a href="https://nerktendo.com/weather-worsener" target="_blank">nerktendo.com/weather-worsener</a>)
- **Type:** Interactive game
- **Key Learning:** Fun iterative projects are great for experimenting

**6. DomainFlip** (<a href="https://nerktendo.com/domainflip" target="_blank">nerktendo.com/domainflip</a>)
- **Type:** Investor-ready startup demo
- **Key Learning:** Clear vision + detailed context = polished results

**7. TrafficVision.Live** (<a href="https://trafficvision.live" target="_blank">trafficvision.live</a>)
- **Type:** Interactive map and database service
- **Key Learning:** AI takes time to discover things like optimization and may need guidance

**Other Projects**
- Raspberry Pi powered instant camera - prints instant picture stickers with text, current date/time
- Blender Addon that optimally rotates a 3D object to minimize its bounding box - useful for manufacturing processes

> **Key Takeaway:** Don't limit yourself. If you think it should exist (no matter how silly), just try to create it. Vibe coding can make testing concepts easier than creating a mockup.

> **Remember:** AI can help with more than just code - it can help prototype your hardware, organize your files, and much more.

## Pick Your Path

Everyone will build the same group project together, but using different tools depending on your comfort level.
