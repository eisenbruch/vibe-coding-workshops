---

### Tool Selection Framework

Ask yourself these questions:

1. **What are you building?** Simple tool/visual vs. complex app
2. **What's your experience level?** Never coded vs. comfortable with code
3. **What's your timeline?** Quick prototype vs. production-ready
4. **What's your budget?** Free tier vs. paid subscription
5. **Do you need automation?** Simple tasks vs. complex multi-step workflows

---

## Core Approaches

### The Vibe Coding Spectrum

All projects exist somewhere on this spectrum between two approaches:

#### Approach 1: Minimal Info → Iterative Refinement

**Example:** [Nerktendo](https://nerktendo.com/)

**How it works:** Start broad, refine through back-and-forth conversation

**✅ Pros:**
- Great for exploring possibilities and experimenting
- Sparks creative directions you wouldn't think of
- Lower barrier to starting

**❌ Cons:**
- Takes more back-and-forth
- May drift from original vision
- Can be difficult to guide refinement with minimal info

---

#### Approach 2: Comprehensive Brief → Execute

**Example:** [DomainFlip](https://nerktendo.com/domainflip)

**How it works:** Define everything upfront - features, style, structure, functions, rules, edge cases

**✅ Pros:**
- Faster to a feature-full, polished result
- Stays true to vision
- Better for complex requirements

**❌ Cons:**
- Requires knowing what you want
- Less room for discovery
- Harder for beginners to write good briefs (but use AI to help)

**How to do it:** Use an LLM (not a coding AI) to create comprehensive planning documents before you start coding.

**DomainFlip workflow:**
1. **Planning phase**: I described my idea with all the details I had to an LLM chatbot
2. **Document creation**: The AI asked clarifying questions, then developed 8 detailed documents covering:
   - Project overview and goals
   - Technical architecture
   - Design specifications
   - Feature requirements and edge cases
3. **Execution phase**: I fed all documents to Claude Code in a single prompt
4. **Result**: One hour later, the complete site was built exactly to spec

**The key:** comprehensive upfront documentation eliminates ambiguity and reduces iteration.

> **🎁 Bonus:** Read through the [DomainFlip summary and build documents](https://github.com/eisenbruch/vibe-coding-workshops/tree/master/docs/domainflip)

---

### Finding Your Approach

Most projects fall somewhere in the middle. Weather Worsener and LinkPee are examples of balanced approaches.

> **💡 Pro Tip:** Use an AI chatbot (not coding assistant) to plan your project in detail, then feed that plan to an AI coding agent. DomainFlip was created with only 1 Claude Code prompt, but it was fed 8 different multi page documents outlining the entire project in extreme detail.

Most of my examples are website related

---

## Working with Claude Code

### Claude Code CLI Commands

| Command    | Purpose                                                                  |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `claude`   | Start Claude in your terminal.                                           |
| `esc esc`  | Go back in conversation and code history.                                |
| `/init`    | Review codebase and create CLAUDE.md documentation file for AI reference |
| `#memory`  | Easily add to CLAUDE.md memory                                           |
| `/compact` | Compact conversation to clear space while keeping some memory            |
| `/clear`   | Better space clearing but loses memory (or quit/restart Claude Code)     |
| `/usage`   | Check current usage level                                                |
| `/resume`  | Resume a previous conversation                                           |
| `/review`  | Code review                                                              |

> **💡 Tip:** Store important instructions in CLAUDE.md to prevent AI from doing unwanted things (overwriting data, unnecessary builds, etc.). CLAUDE.md files exist for your user and each individual project folder where you use Claude Code. Use this to your advantage - global knowledge vs project specific knowledge.

---

### Essential Techniques

#### Interrupt When Needed
Sometimes AI goes off the rails. If you see it going down the wrong path, interrupt it, go back (double tap `esc`), and give better instructions. This saves memory and credits vs. correcting mistakes later. AI is bad at remembering what it did wrong.

#### Self-Checking
Ask your AI to check its own (or your) work for bugs and see if there's room for improvement. Optimizing for resources and speed is generally good (unless it isn't).

#### Working Through Stubborn Bugs

When you have a bug AI can't solve after multiple attempts:

1. Use Claude thinking levels: `think`, `think hard`, `think harder`, `ultrathink`
1. Try a different coding agent (e.g. ChatGPT Codex)
1. Ask 2 different AIs the same question
    1. Give each AI the other's response for analysis
    1. Have both provide updated plans
    1. Give both responses to a new agent for comprehensive summary
    1. Have another new agent read and implement the solution


---

### Debugging Workflow

AI agents fix issues best when given all relevant information:

1. Use browser DevTool Console to look for errors and warnings: AI agents love reading errors and warnings
2. Copy and paste HTML from the DevTool Element Inspector if unsure how to describe an issue
3. Describe what you want and what the issue is in detail
4. Provide full context especially if debugging in a fresh conversation

---

### Advanced Features

#### Claude Agents (Tasks)
Multiple Claude Code instances using skills and tools to autonomously complete complex workflows in parallel.

**Use case:** Analyze reports or data sources simultaneously

**How to use:** Just ask Claude to start some agents (tasks)

#### Custom Commands
Shortcuts for common workflows without detailed descriptions each time.

**Use case:** Super helpful for scraping and cleaning data

**Examples:** `/new-source` and `/commit` (TrafficVision.Live)

#### Git Worktrees

Git worktrees let you work on multiple branches simultaneously without switching contexts or creating separate repository clones.

**What it solves:** Working on a feature while needing to quickly fix a bug on main, or testing different approaches side-by-side

**How to use:**

1. Create a new worktree:
```bash
git worktree add ../project-feature-branch feature-branch-name
```
2. Claude Code can work across worktrees simultaneously
3. Each worktree maintains its own working directory and branch
4. Shared git history means commits from any worktree are available everywhere

**Use cases:**
- Developing a new feature while maintaining production bug fixes
- Testing multiple implementation approaches in parallel
- Code review without disrupting your current work
- Running different versions for comparison testing

**Clean up when done:**
```bash
git worktree remove ../project-feature-branch
```

> **💡 Tip:** Name worktree directories clearly (e.g., `project-name-feature-name`) to avoid confusion when multiple Claude Code instances are running.

> **💡 Tip:** If worktrees are confusing to you (or if any advanced workflow is), ask Claude to do it for you and teach you along the way.

#### MCP Servers

Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers extend Claude's capabilities by connecting to external tools, APIs, databases, and services through a standardized protocol.

**What it is:** An open standard that lets AI assistants securely connect to external data sources and tools without custom integrations for each service.

**Why use it:** 
- Access real-time data beyond Claude's training cutoff
- Connect to your tools (GitHub, Slack, databases, file systems)
- Automate workflows across multiple services
- Get specialized functionality (web search, documentation, browser control)

**Common MCP Servers:**

- **Filesystem** - Read/write local files with permission-based access
- **GitHub** - Manage PRs, issues, and repository operations
- **Puppeteer** - Browser automation and web scraping
- **Context7** - Up-to-date library documentation with version-specific references
- **Brave Search** - Real-time web search results
- **Sequential Thinking** - Break down complex tasks into structured steps
- **Google Drive** - Access and manage Drive documents
- **Slack** - Send messages and interact with Slack workspaces

**Installation - Claude Desktop:**

1. Install Node.js if needed: `brew install node` (macOS)
2. Navigate to Settings → Extensions in Claude Desktop
3. Click "Browse extensions" to install from directory (one-click)

**Installation - Claude Code:**
```bash
# Add server with user scope (available in all projects)
claude mcp add github --scope user

# Add with environment variables
claude mcp add -e API_KEY=your_key servername -- npx @org/server

# List configured servers
claude mcp list

# Check server status
/mcp
```

**Configuration Scopes:**

- **Local** (default) - Only available in current directory
- **User** (`--scope user`) - Available globally across all projects
- **Project** (`.mcp.json`) - Shared with team via version control

> **💡 Tip:** Use user scope for personal tools, project scope for team-shared servers. After adding servers, restart Claude Desktop or Claude Code to activate them.

**Config File Locations:**

- **macOS:** `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
- **Windows:** `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`
- **Claude Code:** `~/.claude.json` (user scope) or `.mcp.json` (project scope)

**Finding More Servers:**

- Official servers: [github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers)
- Community directory: [mcp.so](https://mcp.so)
- Smithery: [smithery.ai](https://smithery.ai)
